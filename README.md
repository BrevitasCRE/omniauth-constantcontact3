# Omniauth::ConstantContact3

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/asanghi/omniauth-constantcontact3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asanghi/omniauth-constantcontact3)

This gem is an OmniAuth 2.0 Strategy for the [ConstantContact V3 API](https://v3.developer.constantcontact.com/api_reference)

It supports the OmniAuth REST API which uses OAuth 2.0

Many thanks to [Caleb Clark](https://github.com/calebclark/omniauth-constantcontact) for writing the original OmniAuth strategy. This builds on his work.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'omniauth-constantcontact3'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install omniauth-constantcontact3

## Usage

Then integrate the strategy into your middleware:

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :constantcontact, ENV['CC_KEY'], ENV['CC_SECRET']
end
```

In Rails, you'll want to add to the middleware stack:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :constantcontact, ENV['CC_KEY'], ENV['CC_SECRET']
end
```

\*\* Ensure that you have provided the correct Redirect URI in Constant Contact when you generated the Key.
You are likely to see an error stating "invalid redirect" if the Request URI does not match the one from your environment.

In development for example the Redirect URI is

    http://localhost:3000/auth/constantcontact/callback

You will have to put in your consumer key and secret, which you can find at http://community.constantcontact.com/t5/Documentation/API-Keys/ba-p/25015
